#  Other Frequently Asked Questions 

> #### Question 1 : Does your product supports both cloud and on-premise hosting (What is the process)?
> Yes, we do support both. 
>
> On-premise hosting requires you to have a server with below mentioned requirements.
>
```js
Linux OS ARM/64 (Ubnutu preferred)
4GB of RAM
25GB of ROM
and tis 
Other tools required, Docker, Docker-compose
```
> We can provide a documentation on how to setup as per your request.
>
> Or we can also visit on site to install it for you.

> #### Question 2 : Is your product just for detecting website vulnerabilities, or does it also track server, cloud, and network issues?
> For the time being, ReconwithMe only scans websites for bugs. However, we intend to scan for network issues in the near future.

> #### Question 3 : Could you kindly explain how the data in the cloud is safeguarded?
> We have security researchers who are constantly monitoring our tool looking for bugs and patching them as soon as possible. Being a company aware about cyber security, we leave no way for attackers to penetrate our network in any way.

> #### Question 4 : What distinguishes you from your market’s competitors, such as Acunetix, Nessus, and others?
> ReconwithMe is a young company with mature team trying our best to meet up with other tools while trying to keep minimal subscription cost in mind. 

> #### Question 5 : Is it capable of scanning APIs? If yes, do we need to view various API’s as separate targets/scopes?
> In black-box testing we try to accumulate as much endpoints as we can gather through just a single target. But we can’t promise to scrap every endpoints from just a single target since its hard to crawl and gather APIs endpoints. But in future we have planned to provide a specific service where user/organization can provide us all their endpoints where our tools will try to find vulnerabilities in it.

> #### Question 6 : Does the tool fulfill the guidelines set by NRB, NTA, PCI, DISS, ISO for audits?
> It clearly complies with ISO and other standards.

> #### Question 7 : Does your product give functions like database scan, database configuration, dynamic analysis, sand boxing
> No, we do not provide such service yet.

> #### Question 8 : Is it necessary to put it on only one server while installing it on premises?
> You have the option of hosting the service on various servers. It is entirely up to you.

> #### Question 9 : Does ReconwithMe inject data on the platform?
> We will have to inject data onto the platform to test for bugs, but  it will be of low impact.

> #### Question 10 : How are the engines built?
> ReconwithMe, which was designed from the scratch and is powerful in and of itself, has a variety of scans applied. However, we also employ a few opensource tools to recon and scan the target, such as findomain and SQLmap.

> #### Question 11 : Will we be able to use it with other applications?
> We can provide our API if organization demands to use their own interface.
